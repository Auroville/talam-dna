# Why Talam Exists?

I (Shankardevy) am writing this journey so that anyone who joins or wishes to join Talam knows my individual journey before I co-founded Talam along with Manoj. While it’s not necessary that every member of Talam to have the same inspiration as what I experienced to be part of Talam, an alignment towards the general philosophy expressed below is important to appreciate the purpose of Talam and help you to be a meaningful contributor of Talam.

## Personal Journey

In the search for a purpose of my life, I have been looking for various philosophies and perspectives that can provide a framework for a meaningful life. All these philosophies that have inspired me in the past have at-least one common thread - which is to live life in a wholesome way.

One of the earliest perspectives that I got exposed to is Zorba The Buddha, a term coined by Osho to symbolize the union of two archetypes: Zorba, representing the enjoyment of life, sensuality, and embracing the material world, and Buddha, representing spiritual enlightenment and transcendence.

> Zorba has to become Buddha, and Buddha has to understand and respect its own foundation. Roots may be ugly, but without those roots there are not going to be any flowers. The flowers may be beautiful, fragrant, but all their juice and all their fragrance comes from the roots. You cannot cut the tree in two saying that roots are ugly; you will destroy the tree. You have destroyed man by cutting him in two, into lower and higher, into material and spiritual. My whole effort is to make you understand a simple thing, that the roots may be ugly, but they are the very life of the most beautiful flowers. The juices that are coming to the flowers are coming from the roots. Without a Zorba, a Buddha is a dead saint, just a corpse with no soul. Without a Buddha, a Zorba is just an animal, not yet evolved into humanity. My vision for the future man is that there will be no split, and we will be able to make this world and that world one, body and soul one, Zorba and Buddha one.

Then came Puruṣārtha which explained the 4 goals of human life as Dharma, Arta, Kama, Moksha.

1. Dharma: Dharma refers to one's moral and ethical duties and responsibilities in life. It encompasses individual and social obligations, righteousness, and the pursuit of a righteous and virtuous life. Fulfilling one's dharma is seen as an essential need for leading a harmonious and purposeful life.
2. Artha: Artha signifies the pursuit of material well-being, wealth, and prosperity. It recognizes the importance of fulfilling one's material needs and providing for oneself and one's family. However, artha is viewed in the context of dharma, where the accumulation of wealth should be done ethically and in alignment with one's duties and responsibilities.
3. Kama: Kama represents the pursuit of pleasure, enjoyment, and aesthetic experiences. It encompasses the fulfillment of sensual and emotional desires, including those related to love, relationships, art, music, and beauty. Kama is considered a legitimate need, but its pursuit should be guided by moderation and ethical conduct.
4. Moksha: Moksha refers to liberation or enlightenment, which is the ultimate goal of human life according to many Indian philosophical traditions. It represents the need for spiritual growth, self-realization, and transcending the cycle of birth and death. Moksha is often associated with the realization of one's true nature, unity with the divine or ultimate reality, and the end of suffering.

Then came Sri Aurobindo’s concept of integral yoga, which is a path that seeks to integrate all dimensions of human existence — physical, vital, mental, and spiritual — into a harmonious and unified whole. A spiritual path made not in seclusion but in the midst of everyday life.

And then came Charles Eisenstein’s book “Sacred Economics: Money, Gift, and Society in the Age of Transition” which proposes that our current monetary system is rooted in separation, scarcity, and exploitation, and he advocates for a shift towards an economy that is aligned with interconnectedness, abundance, and the well-being of all. 

And then came the Dream of Auroville:

> There should be somewhere on earth a place which no nation could claim as its own, where all human beings of goodwill who have a sincere aspiration could live freely as citizens of the world and obey one single authority, that of the supreme truth; a place of peace, concord and harmony where all the fighting instincts of man would be used exclusively to conquer the causes of his sufferings and miseries, to surmount his weaknesses and ignorance, to triumph over his limitations and incapacities; a place where the needs of the spirit and the concern for progress would take precedence over the satisfaction of desires and passions, the search for pleasure and material enjoyment. - The Mother

While I can be a Zorba the Buddha or have an integral growth of my physical, vital, mental and spiritual bodies without making any effort towards improving the society I live in, the idea of Auroville or those expressed in Sacred Economics or those in Purusartha make my individual progress or goal in the context of the society I live in and therefore making the growth in me inseparable from the growth in the society. 

My work today at Talam is towards this intertwined personal and societal growth and this can be summarised in the words of Michael Jackson (Zorba) and Mahatma Gandhi (The Buddha).

> Heal the world
> 
> Make it a better place
> 
> For you and for me
> 
> And the entire human race
> 
> There are people dying
> 
> If you care enough for the living
> 
> Make a better place
> 
> For you and for me

> I'm starting with the man in the mirror
> 
> I'm asking him to change his ways
> 
> And no message could have been any clearer
> 
> If you wanna make the world a better place
> 
> Take a look at yourself and then make a change
> 
> -- Michael Jackson


> We but mirror the world. All the tendencies present in the outer world are to be found in the world of our body. If we could change ourselves, the tendencies in the world would also change. As a man changes his own nature, so does the attitude of the world change towards him. This is the divine mystery supreme. A wonderful thing it is and the source of our happiness. We need not wait to see what others do.

## Invitation to Cocreate
These philosophies reflect the inner state, value of Talam and shape the way we do our work in Talam. You are welcome to read more about these philosophies, discuss and share your views on the same with everyone at Talam. 

These are Talam’s DNA. Everyone is welcome to improve on these by submitting a pull request for others to review before it can be merged as Talam's DNA. For now, I'll act as the composer and orchestrator of Talam's inner state, values, priciples and practices by being the [benevolent dictator for life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life), however, I don't intent to continue this role forever.
